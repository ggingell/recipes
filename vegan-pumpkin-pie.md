# Vegan Pumpkin Pie

## Ingredients

### Crust

- See "Vegan Pie Crust". Use half of the dough for a 9" pie pan, or most all of it for 10" pie pan.

### Filling

- 2 cups    Pumpkin Puree, cooked
- 2 eggs    Equivalent of Ener-G Egg Replacer (Shake in mason jar)
- 1.5 cups  Vegan Sweetened Condensed Milk
- .5 cup    Sugar
- .5 tsp    Salt
- .5 cup    Brown Sugar
- .25 tsp   Nutmeg
- .25 tsp   Allspice
- 1 tsp     Ginger
- 1 tsp     Cinnamin

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 425Â° F. After placing crust in pie pan, carefully line it with tin foil and use pie weights or dried bens to prevent bubbles in the crust. Bake crust for 5 to 10. Remove it from the oven and remove the foil and beans. Reduce oven to 325.

In a large bowl (seriously a huge bowl is worth it) mix in the ingredients for the filling starting with the pumpkin puree, eggs and condensed milk. Whisk the eggs and milk into the puree until even then add the sugar and spice one by one. Thoroughly whisk, being sure to remove any lumps of unmixed ingredient. Pour into pie crust carefully. Place in oven on a middle or lower middle rack and bake for 45 minutes to an hour. Use a fork, toothpick or knife to test done-ness after 45 minutes. It should remain clean when inserted and removed into the center. If not, keep the pie in the oven.

Once done, let the pie cool for a few hours. This is the important part. In order for the filling to have the right texture it must set up after baking. The pie can be served cold or warmed up or once it has initially set up. Sprinkling high quality brown sugar and cinnamin over top of the finished pie can add texture and flavor as well.
