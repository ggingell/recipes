# Quiche

## Ingredients

- 1             Pie crust, normal 9" diameter x 1.5" deep (not a sweet crust!)
- 2.5 cups      Milk
- 3 eggs
- 3 egg yolk
- 1             Sweet or White Onion
- 3oz Cheese    Grated; cheddar, jack, mozarella etc
- 1/3 cup       Brocolli, chopped finely
- 1/3 cup       Cauliflower, chopped finely
- 1/3 cup       Green Pepper, chopped finely

## Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350° F. Boil milk. Whip all of the eggs in a bowl. Stir into the milk carefully once it begins to boil. Sautee oinion in a separate pan in a light oil. Once onions clarify and begin to brown add them to the empty pie crust, lining the bottom and sides. Next add the vegetables as desired. Roughly 1-2 cups total should be sufficient. The amount and type of vegetables is otherwise totally up to you. Broccoli is most typical but spinach, peppers, bok choy, potato, tomato and many others can also work here. Next cover the vegetables with grated cheese. Finally pour the egg and milk mixture over the pie until it is full. Bake for 15-25 minutes at 350° F.
