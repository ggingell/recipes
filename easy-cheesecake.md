# Easy Cheesecake

## Ingredients

- 2         1lb Cream Cheese blocks
- 2         Eggs
- 3/4 cup   Sugar
- 1 tsp     Vanilla
- 1         Pie crust, normal 9" diameter x 1.5" deep
- \*         Toppings of any kind: Fruit, nuts, chocolate, syrups etc.

## Instructions

Soften cream cheese by leaving it at room temperature for a few hours or in lukewarm water if the foil package is still sealed. Mix all ingredients together in large bowl using spatulas or an electric mixer. Pour into pie crust. There are many options for toppings to add at this point. Bake at 350Â° 45 mins to an hour. Once finished let cool down and set for at least 45 minutes on the counter prior to cutting. To make serving easier let cool down completely for a few hours and refrigerate over night.

Use a ready made pie crust or make your own. This recipe doesn't cover that because crust making is an art form to itself.
