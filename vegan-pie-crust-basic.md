# Vegan Pie Crust Basic

## Ingredients

- 2.5 cups    All Purpose Flower
- .75 cup     Vegetable Shortening; Many brands, check the baking aisle. Else there is Crisco.
- 1 tbsp      Coconut Oil (Chilled enough to be solid)
- 2 tbsp      Earth Balance
- .5 cup      Cold Water
- 1.5 tsp     Salt

## Instructions

In a large bowl, or electric mixer bowl with a dough hook, add the flour and salt. (Sift or pour the flower, never scoop.) Work in the shortening, either by hand or on low to medium speed on the mixer. If by hand be sure to work the shortening into the flour and press out any lumps of shortening that are coated in flour. As you run out of shortening to mix in, sprinkle in the cold water and continue to mix. Add the Earth Balance and coconut oil in a similar way. Once dough is thoroughly mixed it should have a workable consistency of clay. If it's still crumbly continue to nead out lumps of shortening. If it's too sticky sprinle flour over the cutting board and on the rolling pin.

Flexible cutting boards are helpful here, but a regular one will work. Depending on the size of your pie pan and personal preference, you may want to use only half the dough. The other half can be stored in a resealable bag or rolled in foil/plastic wrap. In any case, roll out the dough you wish to use into an even thickness on the cutting board. Keep working until it's nearly an inch wider in diameter than your pie pan. This takes expirementing and depends on what you prefer to do with the crust edge as well as the type of lip the pan has. The dough is workable, you have time, so don't panic and tear it. Also a long flexible knife or pastry wire can be used to separate the flattened dough from the cutting board. If you use a flexible board it can be picked up and laid over top of the pie pan and then peeled back.

Once your crust is in the pan, lightly poke holes in the it with a fork. Try not to puncture all the way through however, because the filling can leak through and burn on the underside which can ruin the crust on the bottom.

Preheat oven to 425° F. After placing crust in pie pan, carefully line it with tin foil and use pie weights or dried bens to prevent bubbles in the crust. Bake crust for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove it from the oven and remove the foil and beans. Reduce oven to 325° F.
