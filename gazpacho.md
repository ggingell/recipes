## Instructions

For best results make the tomato juice from scratch. Start with 6-10 ripe on the vine or heirloom tomatoes. With a sharp knife make a X-shaped slice about 1 inch in size on the bottom of each tomato, opposite of the stem. Heat several liters of water in a large pot and, once boiling, add a couple tomatoes carefully. Let them sit in the boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes and remove them to a collander or bowl. Once all tomatoes have been softened they should peel easily. Do this in or over a sink because it is a messy process. Compost the skins or save for another recipe. Blend or process the peeled tomatoes into a liquid. A few tomatoes may also be chopped instead of blended to add some texture to the soup or as a garnish.

Chop the vegetables into fine size pieces, 1/2 inch or smaller. Add the vegetables, garlic and wet ingredients to a blender and puree until it is smooth. Slowly add bread crumbs as desired to thicken the texture. Can be prepared ahead of time and kept in fridge for a day or two. Garnish with basil leaf, chopped tomato, breadcrumbs or pine nuts.
