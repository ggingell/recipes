# Gumbo Z'Herbes

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 ham hocks (about 1 1/2 pounds total), with several 1/2-inch slits cut into them
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 3 bunches (3 pounds total) mixed collard and mustard greens, rinsed and chopped
- 3 cans (14 1/2 ounces each) reduced-sodium chicken broth
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 bay leaf
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- Coarse salt
- 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- Cooked white rice, for serving


## Instructions


1 In a large pot, heat oil over medium. Add ham hocks and onion; cook until onion has softened, about 10 minutes.
2 Add greens; cook, stirring frequently, until wilted, 7 to 9 minutes. Add broth, 6 cups water, garlic, bay leaf, and thyme; season with salt and cayenne.
3 Bring to a boil; reduce to a simmer, and cook the gumbo 2 1/2 hours, or until ham hocks are tender and greens are very tender.
4 Remove ham hocks from pot; shred meat, discarding skin and bones. Return meat to gumbo. Remove and discard bay leaf. Season with salt, and serve over rice.
